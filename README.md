# fifa-worldcup-predictions
This project analyzes and predicts FIFA World Cup 2022 match outcomes using Logistic Regression, and ensemble models and Monte Carlo simulations. The analysis is built upon data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the integration of the ELO rating system for team performance evaluation.

# FIFA World Cup Match Outcome Predictions

## üìå Overview
This project predicts FIFA World Cup match outcomes using **Logistic Regression**, **Monte Carlo Simulations**, and the **ELO rating system**. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and comprehensive analysis of group stage and knockout rounds, comparing predictions against FIFA rankings, betting odds, and actual results.
